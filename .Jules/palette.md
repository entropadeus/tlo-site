## 2025-05-23 - Accessibility: Skip to Content
**Learning:** This site is missing a fundamental accessibility feature: the "Skip to main content" link. This forces keyboard users to tab through the entire navigation menu on every page load to reach the main content.
**Action:** Implemented a skip link that is visually hidden until focused, allowing keyboard users to bypass navigation. Also added ARIA labels to social links which were completely inaccessible (empty links).
