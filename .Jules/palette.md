## 2025-02-19 - Skip Link Visibility in Static Sites
**Learning:** Skip links must have a significantly higher z-index (e.g., >1000) than sticky headers to ensure they are visible when focused, as standard flow positioning often places them behind fixed header elements.
**Action:** Always verify skip link visibility visually against sticky headers and explicitly set z-index in CSS.
