**Learning:** The brand color `--warm` (#E5AC48) fails WCAG AA contrast requirements (approx 2:1) when used against white backgrounds or as a background for white text. This affects buttons, focus rings, and highlighted text.
**Action:** Use `--primary` (#26251F) for essential UI elements like focus rings and text that requires readability. For buttons, consider dark text on warm backgrounds or using the primary color for the button background.
